# Implementing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) Algorithm and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (OAOA) Using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org)

This is a final project for [CS 8395 - Special Topics: Introduction to Quantum Computing]() at [Vanderbilt University](https://vanderbilt.edu) taught by [Dr. Chuck Easttom](http://www.chuckeasttom.com/)

## Problem Statement

Choose an algorithm we have not covered and implement it in the programming language of your choice, along with a paper describing the algorithm, and explaining your choice of algorithm and programming language.

## Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

Introduced by Peruzzo et al. in a July 2014 in their paper [arXiv:1304.3061](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3061), Variationa

## Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

Introduced by Edward Farhi, Jeffrey Goldstone, and Sam Gutmann in their paper [arXiv:1411.4028](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028), QAOA is a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. As stated in the abstract, _"The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed."_
